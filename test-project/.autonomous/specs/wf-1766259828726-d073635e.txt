========================================
FEATURE SPECIFICATION: COUNTER COMPONENT
========================================

OVERVIEW
--------

A minimal, self-contained React counter component built with TypeScript and React hooks. The component displays a numeric counter value (starting at 0) with three buttons to increment, decrement, and reset the value. The counter can go negative and has no external dependencies beyond React.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Functional Requirements:
- Display a counter value starting at 0
- Increment button adds 1 to the current value
- Decrement button subtracts 1 from the current value
- Reset button returns the counter to 0
- Counter must support negative values
- No props required - component is self-contained

Technical Constraints:
- TypeScript with React hooks (specifically useState)
- No external dependencies beyond React
- Inline styles for all styling
- Button labels: +, -, Reset
- Counter value displayed prominently in center
- Buttons displayed below the counter value
- Jest and React Testing Library already configured in project

UI Layout:
- Counter value: Large, centered, prominently displayed
- Buttons: Horizontal row below counter value (- | + | Reset)
- Simple inline styling - functional, not fancy

ARCHITECTURE
------------

File Structure:
src/
  ├── Counter.tsx        # Main component implementation
  ├── Counter.test.tsx   # Unit tests with React Testing Library
  └── index.ts           # Named export barrel

Component Design:
- Type: Functional component
- State Management: Single useState<number> hook for counter value
- Export Style: Named export from Counter.tsx, re-exported through index.ts
- Styling Approach: Inline styles using style prop

Integration Points:
- Exported via src/index.ts as named export: export { Counter } from './Counter'
- Can be imported by other components as: import { Counter } from './components' (or similar based on project structure)

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
--------------------

1. Create Main Component (src/Counter.tsx):
- Define functional component Counter with no props
- Initialize state: const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0)
- Implement three event handlers:
  - handleIncrement: () => setCount(count + 1)
  - handleDecrement: () => setCount(count - 1)
  - handleReset: () => setCount(0)
- Render structure:
  - Container div with centered layout
  - Display counter value in large text
  - Three buttons in horizontal row
- Apply inline styles for:
  - Container: centered alignment, padding
  - Counter display: large font size, bold, centered
  - Buttons: consistent sizing, spacing, basic styling

2. Create Test Suite (src/Counter.test.tsx):
- Import necessary testing utilities from @testing-library/react
- Import Counter component
- Implement test cases:
  1. Initial render: Verify counter displays 0 on mount
  2. Increment functionality: Click + button, verify count increments to 1, click again to verify 2
  3. Decrement functionality: Click - button from 0, verify count goes to -1, click again to verify -2
  4. Reset functionality: 
     - Increment to positive value, click Reset, verify returns to 0
     - Decrement to negative value, click Reset, verify returns to 0
- Use screen.getByText() for button selection
- Use screen.getByText() or test IDs for counter value verification
- Use userEvent.click() or fireEvent.click() for interactions

3. Create Export Barrel (src/index.ts):
- Single line: export { Counter } from './Counter'
- Enables clean imports from other parts of the application

TESTING
-------

Unit Test Coverage:
Tests must verify the following scenarios:

1. Initial State
   - Counter displays 0 when component first renders
   - All three buttons are present and accessible

2. Increment Behavior
   - Clicking + button increases count by 1
   - Multiple clicks continue to increment correctly
   - Works from negative values back to positive

3. Decrement Behavior
   - Clicking - button decreases count by 1
   - Counter can go negative (e.g., from 0 to -1)
   - Multiple clicks continue to decrement correctly

4. Reset Behavior
   - Clicking Reset from positive value returns to 0
   - Clicking Reset from negative value returns to 0
   - Clicking Reset when already at 0 keeps it at 0

Running Tests:
npm test Counter.test.tsx
==
OR
==
yarn test Counter.test.tsx

Manual Verification:
1. Import and render the Counter component in a test page/app
2. Verify initial display shows 0
3. Click each button and verify visual feedback matches expected behavior
4. Verify counter can go negative by clicking - from 0
5. Verify reset works from any state (positive, negative, zero)
