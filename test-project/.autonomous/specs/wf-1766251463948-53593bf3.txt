========================================
FEATURE SPECIFICATION: COUNTER COMPONENT
========================================

OVERVIEW
--------

A minimal, self-contained React counter component that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a numeric value. The component is built with TypeScript and React hooks, supports negative values, and includes comprehensive unit tests.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Functional Requirements:
- Display a numeric counter value starting at 0
- Increment button adds 1 to the current value
- Decrement button subtracts 1 from the current value
- Reset button returns the counter to 0
- Counter can display negative values
- No props required - component is fully self-contained

Technical Constraints:
- TypeScript with React hooks (useState)
- No external dependencies beyond React
- Inline styles for all UI styling
- Button labels: +, -, Reset
- Counter value displayed prominently in center
- Buttons positioned below the counter value
- Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests (already configured)

UI Layout:
    [Counter Value]
  
  [ - ]  [ + ]  [ Reset ]

ARCHITECTURE
------------

File Structure:
src/
├── Counter.tsx          # Main component implementation
├── Counter.test.tsx     # Unit tests with React Testing Library
└── index.ts             # Named export barrel

Component Design:
- Component Type: Functional component using React hooks
- State Management: Single useState hook for counter value
- Export Pattern: Named export (export function Counter)
- Styling Approach: Inline styles using style objects

Integration Points:
- Exported via src/index.ts as named export for consumption by other parts of the application
- No dependencies on other components or services
- Fully standalone and reusable

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
--------------------

1. Create Counter Component (src/Counter.tsx):
- Define functional component Counter with TypeScript
- Initialize state: const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
- Implement three handler functions:
  - handleIncrement: () => setCount(count + 1)
  - handleDecrement: () => setCount(count - 1)
  - handleReset: () => setCount(0)
- Create inline styles object for:
  - Container (flexbox, center alignment)
  - Counter display (large font, prominent styling)
  - Button container (flexbox, horizontal layout)
  - Button styles (padding, margin, cursor)
- Render structure:
  - Outer container div
  - Counter value display
  - Button container with three buttons (-, +, Reset)

2. Create Unit Tests (src/Counter.test.tsx):
- Import @testing-library/react utilities (render, screen, fireEvent)
- Import Counter component
- Implement test cases:
  1. Initial Render Test: Verify counter displays "0" on mount
  2. Increment Test: Click + button, assert value increases to "1", click again, assert "2"
  3. Decrement Test: Click - button from 0, assert "-1", click again, assert "-2"
  4. Reset Test: Increment to positive value, click Reset, assert "0"; decrement to negative value, click Reset, assert "0"
- Use screen.getByRole('button') and screen.getByText() for element queries
- Use fireEvent.click() for button interactions

3. Create Export Barrel (src/index.ts):
- Single line: export { Counter } from './Counter'
- Provides clean import path for consuming code

4. Type Definitions:
- Component return type: JSX.Element (or inferred)
- State type: number (inferred from useState(0))
- Event handlers: () => void
- Style objects: React.CSSProperties

TESTING
-------

Manual Testing Checklist:
1. Component renders without errors
2. Initial counter value displays as "0"
3. Clicking "+" increments: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3...
4. Clicking "-" decrements: 0 → -1 → -2 → -3...
5. "Reset" button returns counter to 0 from any value (positive, negative, or zero)
6. Buttons are interactive with proper cursor styling

Automated Testing:
Run unit tests with Jest:
npm test Counter.test.tsx

Expected Test Coverage:
- ✓ Renders with initial count of 0
- ✓ Increments count when + button is clicked
- ✓ Decrements count when - button is clicked (including negative values)
- ✓ Resets count to 0 from positive value
- ✓ Resets count to 0 from negative value

Acceptance Criteria:
- All unit tests pass
- Component builds without TypeScript errors
- Component can be imported via import { Counter } from './components' (or appropriate path)
- UI is functional and displays counter value clearly
- All three buttons work as specified
